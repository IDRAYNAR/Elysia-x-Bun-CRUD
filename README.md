# Project Readme

## Architecture

- <b>Backend</b> : The backend is written in TypeScript and uses the Elysia framework. It consists of a single entry point file src/index.ts which sets up the Elysia server and defines the routes and handlers for various endpoints. The server listens on port 3000.

- <b>Frontend</b> : The frontend consists of an HTML file public/index.html and a JavaScript file public/script.js. The HTML file contains the basic structure of the bookstore webpage, while the JavaScript file handles fetching data from the backend API and updating the UI dynamically.

- <b>Database</b> : The project uses a SQLite database to store book information. The database is initialized and accessed using the BooksDatabase class defined in src/db.ts. The database is located at database/books.db (bun:sqlite).
